# EDA-Diagnosing-Diabetes

**Scenario:**
In this project, as a data scientist, I am interested in exploring data that look at how certain diagnostic factors affect the diabetes outcome of women patients.

Through this project, I will use my EDA skills to help inspect, clean, and validate the data.

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It contains the following columns:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin
- BMI: Body mass index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
